# CAD Design â€“ IEMS Project

This repository contains the CAD design files for our **Intelligent Energy Management System (IEMS)**, developed as part of the **Tech Mahakumbh Hackathon** and aligned with **SIH 2024 Problem Statement PS 1572**.

The design includes the enclosure and component mounts for integrating batteries, ESP32, sensors, and wiring. It ensures compact, safe, and efficient hardware placement for our energy storage system prototype.
